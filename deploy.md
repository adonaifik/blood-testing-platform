## Step 5: Automatic Updates

Every time you make changes:

   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated blood compatibility table"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your changes!

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If GitHub push fails:
- Make sure you're in the right directory
- Check your GitHub username and repository name
- Try: `git remote -v` to verify the remote URL

### If Netlify deployment fails:
- Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Make sure all files are in the root directory
- Verify `index.html` exists in the root

### If the site doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Make sure all file paths are correct
- Verify JavaScript is loading properly

## ðŸ“± Testing Your Live Site

1. Open your Netlify URL in a browser
2. Test all quiz functionality
3. Check responsive design on mobile
4. Verify all links and buttons work
5. Test the blood compatibility table

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!
